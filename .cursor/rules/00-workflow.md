- Always read: SPEC.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, TASKS.md before coding.
- Pick the first unchecked task in TASKS.md only.
- Produce a plan (5–15 bullets) before editing files.
- Touch only “Allowed files” for that task.
- Implement + add tests.
- Run:
    - `uv run ruff format .`
    - `uv run ruff check .`
    - `uv run pytest -q`
- If any command fails: fix and rerun until green.
- Update TASKS.md: mark task [x], add a Result note.
- Stop. Do not start the next task unless instructed.
