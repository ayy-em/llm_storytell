# LLM-Storytell: Tech Stack
- Python 3.12 because latest stable LTS version
- OpenAI's API was chosen for all LLM prompts (both text-based content and TTS) for simplicity
- **openai** (Python package, >=1.0.0): used for LLM chat completions and for TTS (text-to-speech) API calls. No alternative in the standard library.
- **elevenlabs** (Python package, >=1.0.0): optional TTS provider. Used when `--tts-provider elevenlabs` is set. API key in config/creds.json as ELEVENLABS_API_KEY.
- ruff for linting is a personal preference
- PyYAML (>=6.0) for parsing pipeline configuration YAML files. Python standard library does not include YAML support, and PyYAML is the de facto standard for YAML parsing in Python. Required for T0005 pipeline definition loader.
- jsonschema (>=4.0.0) for validating structured LLM outputs against JSON schemas. Python standard library does not include JSON Schema validation. jsonschema is the standard library for JSON Schema validation in Python and is required to ensure LLM outputs match expected schemas before persisting to state or artifacts. Required for T0020 outline stage and subsequent validation steps.
- **ffmpeg** (external binary, not a Python package): required when TTS/audio is enabled. Used by the audio-prep step for stitching TTS segments, looping and enveloping background music, and mixing voiceover with bg. Must be on PATH. ffprobe is used for voiceover duration. No standard-library alternative for this audio processing.
- **markdown** (>=3.5.0): used by the deliverable-to-book step to convert final_script.md to HTML before PDF export when running with --no-tts. Standard library has no Markdown parser. Required for runs/book/ PDF output.
- **weasyprint** (>=62.0): used by the deliverable-to-book step to render HTML to PDF for no-TTS runs. Standard library cannot produce PDFs. Enables writing the final script as runs/book/{DD-MM-YY}_{app}_{model}.pdf without external binaries like pandoc.
